# 🥗 Green Food

The project 'Green Food' was developed to apply my learnings in React. 

📱The application for mobile consists of food sales from a restaurant like as Ifood. 

In the site you can:<br/>
 ✔️ choosing an item from each category;<br/>
 ✔️ selecting the quantity of the item and<br/>
 ✔️ sending a other to whatsapp.

## 💡 The Idea
The idea is to have a combo with at least one food, one drink and one dessert. The 'check order' button is only activated if you have at least one combo with one item from each category.
