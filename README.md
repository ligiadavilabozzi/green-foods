# Green Foods

The project 'Green Foods' was developed to apply my learnings in React. 

This application consists of: 

- choosing an item from each category,
- selecting the quantity of the item and
- sending a other to whatsapp.

The idea is to have a combo with at least one food, one drink and one dessert. The 'check order' button is only activated if you have at least one combo with one item from each category.
